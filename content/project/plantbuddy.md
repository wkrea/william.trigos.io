Wanting to develop a small IoT solution I built plantbuddy as a standalone solution with device code written in C for **ESP8266** microcontrollers, using **Googles Firebase** infrastructure as a database and **VueJS** as a frontend.
See [repository](https://github.com/anoff/plantbuddy) for details on the system design.
