For a while I have been looking for a way to thoroughly document and present my experiences with various tools and frameworks. After introducing the techradar concept at work I set out to build my own techradar with **VueJS** and **Google Firebase**. Mid of 2019 I started turning this personal application into a solution for others to use. Adding additional backend types to the original Firebase solution I am now hosting a free to use editor for everyone at [editor.devradar.io](//editor.devradar.io). In addition I still run one devradar instance as part of my online CV that details my experience with various tools. The code itself is open for everyone to use on GitHub.
