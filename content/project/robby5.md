Long term project trying to bring **Node.js on robots** to a higher level and integrate it with ROS.
Trying out different cheap hardware components, bringing together resources in one repository needed to create a robot fullstack from hardware to control logic.
This is more of a collaboration project than a single working solution.
Check out the repository to see the different robot systems I implemented in there.
