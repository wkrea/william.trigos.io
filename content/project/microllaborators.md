During a 24h **hackathon** two of us built this distributed web app with augmented reality features.
The solution should enable teachers to get feedback anonymously from everyone in the class without the need for additional expensive equipment.
To participate you need a phone with a browser capable of WebRTC (currently not supported by Safari 2017-05).
Check out the demo and the explanation on the github repo.
