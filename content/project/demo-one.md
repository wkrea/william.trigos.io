Spending a weekend at the worldâ€™s largest demo party (revision 2018) I learned the basics of drawing on a 2D canvas with C++ and how to build basic 3D raytracing and texture mapping on spheres.
No graphic libraries - just code.
Check out the demo link to see the C++ code rendered in a browser using WASM.
